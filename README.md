#  SNAKE LUDO MASTER

This is a snake and ladder GAME. This project contains cpp files.
Used windows GUI (Graphical user interface) to make the project.
The Windows API (also known as the Win32 API, Windows Desktop API, 
and Windows Classic API) is a C-language-based framework for
creating Windows applications. I have managed the length, width,
colour of the GUI window using it. Also applied some graphics in this
project.Used differnt types of header files, oops concept and a huge 
useage of user defined functions. This project needs a higher
concept of Knowledge in algorithm.
